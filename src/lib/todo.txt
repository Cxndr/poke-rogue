- show which tool is equipped to pokemon in storage with icon?
  - or just auto-remove the tool back to inventory. <-- this!

- show stats on inventory pokemon and selectMon.

- speed seems to be not working correctly. higher speed mon not always attacking faster.

- evolutions!
  - evolve post battle at required level in api.
  - "You're pokemon evolved!": display all evolutions at once in a box.
  - don't use currentState. add a new "evolutions" boolean so that we can trigger from any currentState we may be in.

- balance game rounds: too hard early, too easy late.

- fix evolution: pokemon are evolving down! and also not evolving and always showing evolutions (not clearing correctly in NewEvolutions.tsx??)
